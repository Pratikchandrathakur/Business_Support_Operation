Johns Hopkins is setting up three Charter schools in Baltimore City: Kyoko HS, Devon HS, and Manny HS. Each high school has a capacity of 900 students. 
The Mayor hires your company to assign accepted students to these three new high schools. Busses will be provided to students who live more than walking distance (defined as 1.5 miles) to the schools.
Baltimore City has been partitioned into five neighborhoods: A, B, C, D and E. Kyoko HS is in sector B, Devon HS is in sector C, and Manny HS is in sector E.
If a student lives in a sector and is assigned to the high school in that sector, the student can walk to school and does not get a bus. All students must be assigned a school. 
The table below shows the distance (in miles) from each sector to each school. Minimize the total student miles travelled by bus.
