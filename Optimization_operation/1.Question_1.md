Scenario
A candidate for mayor has allocated $40,000 for last minute advertising in the days preceding the election. 
Two types of ads will be used: radio and television. Each radio ad costs $200 and reaches an estimated 3000 people. 
Each television ad costs $500 and reaches an estimated 7000 people. The campaigning mayor would like to reach as many people as possible, but she has stipulated that at least 10 ads of each type be used.
Also, the number of radio ads must be at least as great as the number of television ads.
1. How many ads of each type should be used?
2. How many people will be reached?
